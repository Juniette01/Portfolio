              <h3>Objective</h3>
              <p>Prototype a social app that encourages behavior change in families in terms of climate change.</p>
              &nbsp;
              <h3>Solution</h3>
              <p>BeeGreen, a habit-challenge app, will encourage positive behaviors in families and friends via a reward system. It will allow users to sign up for challenges that track and change behaviors in exchange for points. These points can be “cashed in” for rewards from local businesses.</p>
              &nbsp;
              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>The BeeGreen app will encourage positive behavioral changes in its users by allowing them to track their daily habits.
              </p><p> Users will be able to track which products they recycle the most, compare how much meat and vegetables they eat (among other options), see how often they use different kinds of transportation, and keep track of their eco-friendly behaviors. Users will earn points and badges for logging their habits.
                </p><p>Users will also be able to compete with their friends in different challenges, with a special amount of points given to the winner of each challenge. Users will also earn badges for competing in challenges.
                </p><p>BeeGreen encourages users to continue using they app by allowing them to exchange their points for rewards from local businesses.

                <p>How is climate change awareness being handled? Who are other competitors?</p>
                &nbsp;
                &nbsp;

                <h4>Sketches</h4>
                <p>Sketch preliminary ideas.</p>
                <p>The original idea was to have a game-like app that would allow users to look after their planet, fill out quizzes to learn information, and compete with others. It would allow users to earn points based on their daily habits, which could be traded for in-game items.

                <h4>Initial Prototype</h4>
                <p>Create initial prototypes based on sketches. Go through several iterations and new sketches using feedback.

                                        The social aspect would be that they could compete with their friends. During user testing, a participant suggested that perhaps they could compete with other users (like a community challenge) if they still wanted to use the app, but didn’t have many friends to compete with.

                <p>Can you join more than one challenge? Can you compete with people in your neighborhood if you don’t have a lot of friends? Can I use it by myself?
